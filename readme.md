ðŸ’¡ Abstract: 

The Young Tableau is a versatile and efficient data structure that offers a compact 
representation for maintaining a matrix of elements. It excels in scenarios where 
ordering and retrieval of the elements are critical operations. In this implementation, 
the Young Tableau represents a matrix using a row-major layout. This means that the elements 
in the matrix are stored in a linear array, with each row of the matrix placed consecutively in the array. 
By utilizing this row-major representation, efficient algorithms can be implemented for element 
insertion, minimum element extraction, and other table-related operations. 
This implementation showcases the power of the Young Tableau as a 
valuable tool in various applications requiring ordered collections. ðŸ“ŠðŸ’ª
# How to run the code
Run the `Young-Diagram-Tester.py` file, 
input the number of all elements and the number of rows and columns of your desired 2D matrix. Remeber that
n shal equal the number of input rows times the number of input columns. Then the program will create a 1D array of size n 
with random numbers from 10 to 99, 
and print it in a 2D style with taken number of rows and columns. At last, it will sort the elements and
print the diagram again.
I shall mention that the `Young-Diagram.py` file contains all the codes and funstions needed to implement the
Young diagram and the `Young-Diagram-Tester.py` file is a tester file for that module.
